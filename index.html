<h1>Hello There!</h1>
<h2>My name is William Smith and you have reached my personal webpage.</h2>
<br>
<h3>My story so far:</h3>
<body>
	<p style=text-indent:40px;> My name is William Walker Smith. I was born to Gary and Diane Smith 
	in Austin Texas on June 27th 1995. <br> Shortly thereafter, my family 
	moved to the small (or at least it was small in 1995) town of Liberty
	Hill. <br> There I spent my childhood running, biking, and exploring
	the nature of the Hill Country. In 2014 I graduated <br> Liberty Hill High 
	School, and moved to Golden Colorado to begin studying at the Colorado
	School of Mines. </p>
	<p style=text-indent:40px;> It was a truly life changing, 
	mind opening experience where I met life-long friends and began to learn <br> about 
	myself. After two semesters at Mines, I decided to transfer to a larger
	University. I had passed all of <br> my classes and could have returned, 
	but I was unhappy with my academic performance nontheless, and I <br> felt
	like even though Mines was an amazing engineering school, I wanted a 
	more rounded education and <br> experience. </p> 
	<p style=text-indent:40px;> At this point I had to consider my options, 
	and I had already applied to the University of
	Arkansas <br> out of high school and had been accepted. Most of my dad's 
	family is from Arkansas, and I spent a large <br> amount of my childhood visiting
	my grandparents. I had been to the University in Fayetteville multiple <br>
	times, and after a fair amount of consideration, I decided to transfer. 
	The change was much more difficult <br> than I had anticipated, and the first
	couple of years at the U of A were some of the loneliest and challenging <br>
	I had experienced in my short life. It was during this time that I 
	realized my current major, mechanical <br> engineering, was not actually 
	something I had much interest in. This discovery, along with the pure exhaustion <br>
	of tyring to become an engineer led me to the decision to take a 
	semester off. I went to work as a waiter and <br> took a break from academics. </p>
	<p style=text-indent:40px;>During this time I had a conversation with a good friend from Texas who <br>
	brought up software engineering. It was during this conversation that I 
	started to think about coding as a <br> career. No doubt, software is a 
	superbly difficult field, but the difference was that I actually enjoyed it. <br>
	Not just as a class, or a potential career, but just coding itself. I 
	love creating tools or games from the ground <br> up, and having total and 
	complete control of all of their aspects. I returned to the University
	of Arkansas in <br> 2018 and by December 2020 I had graduated with a degree in 
	computer science. This, of course, was smack <br> right in the middle of the 
	coronavirus pandemic. Nonetheless, I was able to find employement as a 
	Junior <br> Software Engineer at a small startup in Fayetteville known as 
	Field Agent. It served as an invaluable <br> experience, and I learned much
	during my time there. Unfortunately in Augest of 2022, I, along with a 
	big <br> chunk of the dev team was laid off. </p> 
	<p style=text-indent:40px;> Now I find myself at a crossroads once again.
	Initially after being laid off, I looked for another <br> coding opportunity in 
	Northwest Arkansas, but after time has passed, and I've considered my options, <br>
	now feels like the moment for a change. There is a variety of reasons that a 
	move back to Austin makes <br> sense right now, and I'm ready to take the leap. So 
	look out ATX, I'm coming home. </p>

<h3>For potential employers:</h3>
<body>
	Why should you hire me? <br> Great question. <br> Here's my pitch: 
	<p style=text-indent:40px> I don't want to just code for the sake of a paycheck or health insurance. While I 
	do desire those things, <br> what I want the most is to be good at what I do. I know I 
	have skill when it comes to writing software. I've <br> proven it to myself, my professors, 
	and my previous empoyers. But I know that I have so much more to learn. <br> One of the 
	few frustrations I experienced while working at Field Agent was, funnily enough, a 
	lack of criticism. <br> After completing an assignment, I would often hear "good job", 
	or "nice work", and that would be that.<br> <b>That bothered me.</b> I want to know why you 
	think I did a good job, or how I could have done it better. What <br> would you have done?
	Are you really happy with my work, or is it just good enough? Because "good enough" <br>
	is not good enough for me. I'm not just interested in getting work done efficiently,
	I want to get better at my job. <br> In retrospect, I should have expressed these feelings 
	at the time, and I intend to in the future if they return, but <br> we live and we learn. 
	So there you have it. I'm an intelligent, energetic dude with a passion for what I do 
	and <br> a burning desire to be better at it.</p>
